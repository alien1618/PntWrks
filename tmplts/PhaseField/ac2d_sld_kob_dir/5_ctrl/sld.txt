4.0     a_2 controls the number of primary branches

0.018   delta the smaller it is the more dendrite splitting

0.01    eps_4 directly related to the intrf thickness

0.0     theta0 preferential growth angle

0.0002  tau0

0.9     alpha smaller it is the smaller the solidification rate

9.0     gamma (the higher it is the more non-constant the intrf thickness. smaller it is the more the surface tension)

0       equilibrium temperature

1.8     latent heat of fusion
